<h2>Quick reference</h2>
</header>
<p><b>Top of the window</b>: You can see many buttons each denoting a different kind of matrix or vector operation. Click on one of the buttons and the desired operation becomes active. They are explained in detail further below in the <a href="#vectorops">vector operations</a> and <a href="#matrixops">matrix operations</a> section.</p>

<p><b>Dimension chooser</b>: Select the number of dimensions (2D, 3D, 4D) with the control on top in the middle.</p>

<p><b>Gear icon (in the middle on the top)</b>: All kinds of <a href="#settings">settings</a>.</p>

<p><b>Bottom of the window</b>: This is where the operation is performed. Enter the matrix or vector values in the textfields. Results will be computed immediately and are indicated by a <span style="color:green">green</span> color.</p>

<p><b>Quick Help Line</b>: Displays or hides a one-line help denoting what the currently selected operation does.</p>
<p><b>Identifiers</b>: Displays or hides the identifiers above a matrix or vector. Note: <span style="color:red">errors</span> and <span style="color:orange">warnings</span> will still be displayed, even if this is turned off.</p>
<p><b>Tab order</b>: Defines how you advance through a matrix with the tab key.</p>
<p><b>Code style</b>: Displays or hides the code text field below a matrix or vector. You can choose between different <a href="#codestyle">code styles</a>.</p>
<p><b>Help</b>: Displays this help.</p>

<h2>Code Style</h2>
</header>
<p>There does not exist a standard method on how a matrix or a vector shall be copied and pasted between applications. The easiest way is to encode the matrix in a string. When enabling a specific code style in the <a href="#settings">Settings</a>, you can copy and paste a matrix or vector from and to different applications.</p>
<p>There are different code styles which you can choose from:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>No code</td><td></td><td>Hides the code textfield</td></tr>
<tr><td>C row first 1D</td><td><code>{1, 2, 3, 4}</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>C row first 2D</td><td><code>{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>C column first 1D</td><td><code>{1, 3, 2, 4}</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>C column first 2D</td><td><code>{{1, 3}, {2, 4}}</code></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Mathematica</td><td><code>{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}</code></td><td>always row first</td></tr>
<tr><td>Matlab</td><td><code>[1 2; 3 4]</code></td><td>always row first</td></tr>
<tr><td>Maple</td><td><code>[[1, 2], [3, 4]]</code></td><td>always row first</td></tr>
</table>
<p><b>Important</b>: The code styles are only for outputting. When you paste code from - for example - Matlab into Matrix Buddy, no special construction operators are allowed!</p>

<p>When you paste code into the code textfield, Matrix Buddy tries to find all values in the given string as a strictly sequential list and fills all remaining values with 0 if not found. Pasted code starting with a curly bracket <code>{</code> will always be interpreted as C style code and hence will be interpreted column first if you have selected one of the column first options. In any other case, the pasted values will be interpreted row first.</p>

<p>Note that support for storing a matrix or a vector internally in a list is planned but not implemented yet. For now, just use a plain text editor to store your matrix or vector data.</p>
